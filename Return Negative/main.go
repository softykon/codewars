/*In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples

MakeNegative(1)    // return -1
MakeNegative(-5)   // return -5
MakeNegative(0)    // return 0
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense. */
